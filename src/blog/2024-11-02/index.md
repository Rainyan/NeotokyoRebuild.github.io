## New features

### Deathmatch

Deathmatch is the free-for-all equivalent to TDM with both CTG capture points & ghost disabled, and enables respawning. Win by achieving 50 XP or after the timer runs out (10.25 minutes)

The new ConVars for these settings are as follows:

* `neo_vote_game_mode` - 1 by default, Vote on game mode to play. TDM=0, CTG=1, VIP=2, **DM=3**
* `neo_dm_round_timelimit` - 10.25 by default, DM round time limit, in minutes.
* `neo_sv_dm_win_xp` - 50 by default, XP limit to win the match.
* `neo_sv_dmspawn_useent` - Default 0, override to use map's deathmatch spawn entity over the dmspawn loc file.
* `neo_sv_dm_max_class_dur` - Default 5s, maximum duration you're allowed to pick a class post-spawning in.
* `neo_sv_warmup_godmode` - 0 by default, if 1, everyone takes no damage at all, regardless of bullets, fall, or grenades during idle or warmup state.

In addition, new ConCommands (for local servers only) have been added to customize dm spawning locations:

* `neo_sv_dmspawn_create` - Create a dmspawn spawn.
* `neo_sv_dmspawn_removeall` - Remove all dmspawn spawns.
* `neo_sv_dmspawn_printlocs` - Print all coordinates of the dmspawn spawns.
* `neo_sv_dmspawn_save` - Save the map's loc dmspawn file.
* `neo_sv_dmspawn_load` - Load the map's loc dmspawn file.
* `neo_sv_dmspawn_teleportnext` - Teleport to the next dmspawn spawn.
* `neo_sv_dmspawn_mapinfo` - Check amount of dmspawn spawns and if it can DM.

If you wish to customize the spawns for a dedicated server, be sure to copy the generated .loc files located in `/neo/maps/dm_locs` to the server.

### Streamer Mode

NT;RE is now able to detect OBS running and introduces safeguards for streamers. This includes no user avatars and replaces all names with preset generic names.

Streamer mode can be enabled in the options menu, or by typing `neo_cl_streamermode 1` in the developer console. The auto OBS detection can also be enabled in the options menu or with `neo_cl_streamermode_autodetect_obs 1` (This requires a game restart to take effect.)

### Clan Tags

Clan Tags can now be set in the options menu, or by typing `neo_clantag <tag>` in the developer console. Server owners can opt out of clan tags being show by adding `neo_sv_clantag_allow 0` to their server configuration files. If all players on a team have a matching clan tag, the team's name will reflect the tag set.

### Viewmodel Only Lean

Players now have the option to enable viewmodel only leaning. This prevents a roll effect to the camera view while leaning. Option can be changed in the options menu, or by typing `cl_neo_lean_viewmodel_only 1` in the developer console.
