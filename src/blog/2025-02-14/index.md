## New features

### Automatic lean

Players now have the option to enable automatic leaning. This prevents the use of manual leaning. Option can be changed in the options menu, or by typing `cl_neo_lean_automatic 1` in the developer console.

## New additions

* Added an experimental toggle for weapon viewkick `sv_neo_dynamic_viewkick` (off by default). Makes the weapon's viewkick proportional to the inaccuracy - the longer you shoot, the more viewkick there is.

## Gameplay changes/fixes

* Thermal and motion vision have been reworked to act and look more like they do in original NEOTOKYO°

* Grenade behavior is now closer to original NEOTOKYO°
* Jitte hip fire spread has been fixed, the maximum hip spread has been decreased from 10 degrees to 7 degrees

* Penetration and damage for slugs have been fixed
* Fixed a case where two bullets were fired in the same frame
* Fixed vision modes on maps that use colour correction and/or HDR

* General movement fixes to more resemble the movement in original NEOTOKYO° (do note that there are still minor changes to be made to reach movement parity)
* Player camera does not stay leaned anymore after death
* Fixed the ghost not playing beeps for nearby enemies when picked up
