## JGR Gamemode
Team-based gamemode where you take control of the Juggernaut (robot) as long as possible per round to win.
The team(s) without the Juggernaut will respawn, with the mech will not respawn.

At the start of each round, the Juggernaut will spawn in and like the ghost will be visible in the HUD, once someone
is controlling the Juggernaut, it will not show up in the HUD.
When you're by the Juggernaut, hold use to take control then when inside try to stay alive for as long as
possible to rack up points. The Juggernaut is equipped with a big machine gun and is much
larger than a player.
